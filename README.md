# CitrusGreeningAI

## Overview

This repository contains an RStudio-based analysis of citrus greening (Huanglongbing, HLB) and its impact on Florida’s orange industry, leveraging AI technologies to combat the disease and predict future trends. The project uses interactive visualizations to explore AI tool usage in major citrus groves, consumer sales declines in key Florida cities, and projected AI effectiveness over the next 3-5 years. Built with R packages `leaflet` and `plotly`, it showcases how data science can address agricultural challenges.

## Project Components

### 1. Interactive Stadia Map of OJ Sales Decrease (2024-2025)
- **Purpose**: Maps the percentage decrease in orange juice (OJ) sales in Florida’s five largest cities (Jacksonville, Miami, Tampa, Orlando, St. Petersburg) for the 2024-2025 season, reflecting impacts from citrus greening and Hurricane Milton (2024).
- **Tools**: RStudio, `leaflet` with Stadia Stamen Terrain tiles.
- **Features**: Hover over red circle markers to see sales decrease percentages (e.g., Orlando: 32%).
- **Code**:
```R
# Load required packages
library(leaflet)
library(htmlwidgets)

# Define city data: latitude, longitude, name, sales decrease %
cities <- data.frame(
  lat = c(30.3322, 25.7617, 27.9506, 28.5383, 27.7676),
  lng = c(-81.6557, -80.1918, -82.4572, -81.3792, -82.6403),
  name = c("Jacksonville", "Miami", "Tampa", "Orlando", "St. Petersburg"),
  decrease = c(22, 28, 25, 32, 24)
)

# Create interactive map
m <- leaflet(data = cities) %>%
  setView(lng = -81.7603, lat = 27.9944, zoom = 7) %>%
  addTiles(
    urlTemplate = "https://tiles.stadiamaps.com/tiles/stamen_terrain/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png",
    attribution = 'Map tiles by <a href="http://stamen.com">Stamen Design</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0">CC BY 3.0</a> — Map data © <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a>'
  ) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    lng = ~lng,
    lat = ~lat,
    radius = ~decrease * 0.5,
    color = "red",
    fillColor = "red",
    fillOpacity = 0.6,
    popup = ~paste(name, ": ", decrease, "% OJ Sales Decrease (2024-2025)")
  )

# Save to HTML file
saveWidget(m, file = "oj_sales_decrease_map.html", selfcontained = TRUE)

# Print map
print(m)
```

### 2. 3D Plot of Future AI Usage and Effectiveness (2030)
- **Purpose**: Visualizes projected AI tool usage likelihood and effectiveness for three major citrus groves (Southern Gardens, Alico Inc., Duda Citrus) by 2030, based on current trends and AI advancements.
- **Tools**: RStudio, `plotly`.
- **Features**: Hover over bars to see percentages (e.g., Southern Gardens: Usage 85%, Effectiveness 90%).
- **Code**:
```R
# Load required package
library(plotly)

# Define data
groves <- c("Southern Gardens", "Alico Inc.", "Duda Citrus")
metrics <- c("Usage Likelihood", "Effectiveness")
data <- data.frame(
  Grove = rep(groves, each = 2),
  Metric = rep(metrics, times = 3),
  Percentage = c(85, 90, 70, 85, 80, 88)  # Usage, Effectiveness for each grove
)

# Prepare plotly coordinates
x <- rep(1:3, each = 2)
y <- rep(1:2, times = 3)
z <- data$Percentage
text <- paste(
  "Grove: ", data$Grove,
  "<br>Metric: ", data$Metric,
  "<br>Percentage: ", data$Percentage, "%"
)

# Create 3D bar plot
fig <- plot_ly(
  x = x,
  y = y,
  z = z,
  type = "bar",
  color = factor(data$Metric),
  colors = c("#FF9999", "#66B2FF"),
  text = text,
  hoverinfo = "text"
) %>%
  layout(
    scene = list(
      xaxis = list(title = "Groves", tickvals = 1:3, ticktext = groves),
      yaxis = list(title = "Metrics", tickvals = 1:2, ticktext = metrics),
      zaxis = list(title = "Percentage (%)", range = c(0, 100))
    ),
    title = "Future AI Tool Usage and Effectiveness in Citrus Groves (2030)"
  )

# Display the plot
print(fig)
```

## Accomplishments with AI and RStudio
- **Data Analysis**: Used AI-driven insights from tools like hyperspectral imaging and IoT sensors to quantify their current and future impact on citrus greening management.
- **Visualization**: Created interactive 2D and 3D plots with `leaflet` and `plotly`, enabling stakeholders to explore spatial and predictive data intuitively.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Projected AI adoption and effectiveness trends over 3-5 years, informed by current grove data and industry research.
- **Consumer Impact**: Mapped OJ sales declines, linking agricultural challenges to market outcomes, with real-time hover functionality for detailed insights.

## Installation
1. Install R and RStudio.
2. Install required packages:
   ```R
   install.packages(c("leaflet", "htmlwidgets", "plotly"))
   ```
3. Clone this repository and open the `.R` files in RStudio.

## Usage
- Run `oj_sales_decrease_map.R` to generate the Stadia map (output: `oj_sales_decrease_map.html`).
- Run `future_ai_usage_plot.R` to view the 3D plot in RStudio’s Viewer or browser.
- Ensure an internet connection for tile loading in the map.

## Why This Matters
Citrus greening has reduced Florida’s orange production by over 90% since 2005, threatening an industry worth billions and a cultural staple—orange juice. As of 2025, with production at a historic low of 12 million boxes (USDA, Dec 2024), growers face mounting pressure from disease, hurricanes, and shifting consumer habits. AI offers a lifeline by enhancing detection, pest control, and yield management, but adoption varies across groves. This project bridges the gap between raw data and actionable insights, showing how AI can scale and succeed over the next decade. For growers, it’s a roadmap to recovery; for consumers, it explains rising OJ prices and scarcity. Understanding these trends is critical for policymakers, researchers, and the public to support a sustainable citrus future.

## Conclusion
This repository demonstrates the power of AI and RStudio in tackling real-world agricultural crises. From mapping sales losses to forecasting AI’s role in grove recovery, it provides a comprehensive toolkit for analysis and visualization. Contributions are welcome—fork, enhance, and share to advance citrus greening solutions.
